<!-- How To Create and Run Tests -->
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Create a new file under test folder
2) Add module ‘playwright/test’
    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
    
    ** test, expect  ------ functions from @playwright/test module
    Playwright Test provides a test function to declare tests and expect function to write assertions

3) Create a test block - test(title, testFunction)
    The keyword 'async' before a function makes the function return a promise
    The keyword 'await' before a function makes the function wait for a promise

4) Run the test
    1) npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed  FirstTest.spec.js
    2) npx playwright test                 runs all tests on all browsers in headless mode
    3) npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js            runs a specific test file
    4) npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js  MyTest2.spec.js           runs the files specified
    5) npx playwright test -g "test title"             runs test with the title
    6) npx playwright test --project=chromium      runs on specific browser
    7) npx playwright test --headed         runs tests in headed mode
    8) npx playwright test --debug         debug tests
    9) npx playwright test example.spec.js --debug           debug specific test file
